## Project description
Despite significant advances in bioprinting technology, current hardware platforms lack the capability for process monitoring and quality control. This limitation hampers the translation of the technology into industrial GMP-compliant manufacturing settings. As a key step towards a solution, we developed a novel bioprinting platform integrating a high-resolution camera for in-situ monitoring of extrusion outcomes during embedded bioprinting. Leveraging classical computer vision and image analysis techniques, we then created a custom software module for assessing print quality. This module enables quantitative comparison of printer outputs to input points of the CAD modelâ€™s 2D projections, measuring area and positional accuracy. To showcase the platform's capabilities, we then investigated compatibility with various bioinks, dyes, and support bath materials for both 2D and 3D print path trajectories. In addition, we performed a detailed study on how the rheological properties of granular support hydrogels impact print quality during embedded bioprinting, illustrating a practical application of the platform.
